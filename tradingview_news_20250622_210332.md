## 1. Despite Trump’s backing, crypto is choosing MiCA over America: Paybis

**列表標題**: Cointelegraph

**內容**:
Europe is pulling ahead in the global crypto race under its Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) framework, outpacing even President Donald Trump’s crypto-friendly America.
According to Konstantins Vasilenko, co-founder and chief business development officer at Paybis, trading volumes from EU customers jumped 70% quarter-on-quarter in Q1 2025, right after the MiCA regulation took effect.
During the same period, Paybis activity in the US started trending in the opposite direction. Vasilenko told Cointelegraph that while US retail activity was declining, European users have been placing larger, more deliberate trades.
Other platforms have reported similar shifts in user behavior. Kaiko estimates that only 18% of Coinbase’s spot trading volume now comes from retail customers, down from 40% in 2021. On Robinhood, crypto trading volume fell by 35% in the first quarter of 2025.
“The timing is hard to ignore,” said Vasilenko. “MiCA’s licensing window opened on January 1, 2025; in that very quarter, our EU volumes jumped 70% while the number of trades hardly moved, which tells me the new money was larger and more deliberate.”
Crypto firms secure MiCA licneses
Several crypto firms have already adapted their strategies to align with MiCA. OKX, Crypto.com and Bybit have obtained licenses under the new framework, with Coinbase becoming the latest to gain the license from the Luxembourg Commission de Surveillance du Secteur Financier.
The renewed investor confidence in Europe is driven by key features of MiCA, according to Vasilenko. For one, the MiCA framework introduced a single licensing regime across all EU member states. Once authorized in one country, crypto firms can operate throughout the bloc.
“Once a crypto-asset service provider is authorized in any member state, it can “passport” the same license across the rest of the states, so retail clients know their legal protections travel with them,” Vasilenko said.
Furthermore, MiCA enforces strict rules on stablecoins, requiring full 1:1 reserves, audits, and asset segregation. It also introduces MiFID-style protections like clear disclosures, cooling-off periods, and transparent fees, reducing uncertainty for investors.
On the other hand, in the US, persistent regulatory confusion continues to hold the market back. Despite favorable rhetoric from President Trump and members of his administration, no sweeping federal crypto legislation has materialized.
“State-by-state money-service licenses, unresolved SEC lawsuits, and sudden delistings mean ordinary users still can’t tell which coins, or even which staking products, will be available next month,” Vasilenko said.
France emerges as standout
France, in particular, has emerged as a standout in Europe. Vasilenko said Paybis saw a 175% spike in crypto activity in the country, thanks in part to its head start under the 2019 PACTE law, which already required AML registration for exchanges.
The presence of top fintech hubs like Station F and the AMF’s proactive regulatory stance have helped make France one of Europe’s most crypto-engaged countries, with penetration expected to reach 24% of the population this year.
Germany leads in institutional infrastructure, with Deutsche Boerse’s Clearstream set to offer crypto settlement services. The Netherlands, meanwhile, continues to punch above its weight with strong payment connectivity.
According to Vasilenko, the idea of a single “hub” may become outdated. “Liquidity pools in Frankfurt or Paris, customer support in Dublin, and compliance ops in Vilnius — all under the single MiCA umbrella,” he said.
The US could still see a comeback. The GENIUS Act, currently making its way through Congress, could introduce a unified licensing regime and clear definitions for dollar-backed stablecoins. If passed by year-end, Vasilenko believes it “would do for US retail what MiCA just did for Europeans.”

## 2. Bitcoin Dominance Skyrockets as ETH and Other Altcoins Plummet

**列表標題**: Cointelegraph

**內容**:
Bitcoin’s price took another turn for the worse in the past 24 hours after the US attacked multiple Iranian nuclear sites, and the asset plunged to a multi-week low.
The altcoins have posted even more notable price declines, which is evident from the growing BTC dominance.Bitcoin Tries to Recover
The business week began on a different note as the primary cryptocurrency shot from under $105,000 to $109,000 by Tuesday. However, it faced an immediate and violent rejection that pushed it south hard as the tension in the Middle East continued to rage on.
In a matter of hours, BTC dumped to $103,500 before the bulls initiated an impressive leg up that drove the asset higher by around $3,000. Nevertheless, the overall negative market sentimentcontinued, and bitcoin started to lose value once again in the following days.
The culmination came earlier today as the US launched “successful” attacks against multiple nuclear sites in Iran, as described by the POTUS. Moreover, Trump warned that there will be more violent strikes if Iran decides to retaliate in any form.
Bitcoin’s pricetumbledbelow $101,000 for the first time in almost three weeks. However, it remained within a six-digit price territory and has recovered to $102,500 as of now.
Its market cap is down to $2.040 trillion on CG, but its dominance over the alts has skyrocketed to almost 63% as most bleed out.Alts Deep in Red
The rising BTC dominance in times when the cryptocurrency’s price is dropping means only one thing – the alts have it even worse. Interestingly, it’s not just the lower caps that are suffering badly. Ethereum, the largest of the bunch, has dumped by over 7% in the past 24 hours and is close to breaking below $2,200. Recall that ETH stood tall close to $2,800 just until a week ago.
Solana, Dogecoin, Cardano, SUI, LINK, HBAR, and LINK are also deep in the red from the bigger alts. Even more painful declines come from VIRTUAL, APT, INJ, TIA, TAO, SEI, JUP, FET, and PEPE, as all of them are down by double-digits on a daily scale.
These developments are only supporting a recent report, which claimed that those hoping for an altseason are relying mostly on “wishful thinking” rather than any hard data.

## 3. Bitcoin price risks sub-$100K dive after Trump confirms Iran strikes

**列表標題**: Cointelegraph

**內容**:
Key points:
Bitcoin sees a snap reaction to news of direct US involvement in the Israel-Iran conflict, dipping below $102,000.
Traders note that war-based headlines have acted as a BTC price springboard in the past.
Price analysis suggests that a local bottom may coincide with order book liquidity at around $97,000.
Bitcoin
BTCUSD
risked new month-to-date lows into the June 22 weekly close as geopolitical threats soured crypto sentiment.
Bitcoin can still gain from war headlines — Traders
Data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro and TradingView showed
BTCUSD
falling under $102,000 as US President Donald Trump confirmed strikes on nuclear facilities in Iran.
Iran, Trump said during a televised address uploaded to Truth Social, “must now make peace” or face additional strikes.
Ahead of what promised to be a volatile open to the Wall Street trading week, Bitcoin traders began considering potential BTC price bottom levels.
“A dump towards $93K-$94K before bottom formation and reversal,” popular trader Cas Abbe suggested, adding that the low $90,000 zone only had a “20%-25% chance” of being reached.
Abbe and others referenced events in April, when
BTCUSD
suffered following the announcement of reciprocal US trade tariffs before beginning a sustained rebound to new all-time highs.
“In 2022, $BTC pumped +42% in 35 days after the Ukraine war began. That was deep in a bear market,” fellow trader Merlijn continued with another historical geopolitical comparison.
“Now it’s 2025. War fears rise again. But Bitcoin’s above $100K. And we’re still in a bull market. What happens if history repeats with more fuel?”
$97,000 BTC price support in play
With hours until the weekly close, however, BTC price strength still lacked conviction, leaving a key level out of reach.
“I remain long over $93,500, but remember i really want to see the $104,500 hold for the bulls to remain in control,” trader Crypto Tony told X followers about the issue on the day.
BTCUSD
thus remained on course for its lowest weekly close since the start of May.
Previously, Cointelegraph reported on exchange order book liquidity, potentially providing the first major support band at around $97,000.
Data from monitoring resource CoinGlass showed that the area remained significant at the time of writing.

## 4. Texas governor signs bill adding Bitcoin to official reserves

**列表標題**: Cointelegraph

**內容**:
Texas Governor Greg Abbott has signed Senate Bill 21 (SB21), officially authorizing the creation of the Texas Strategic Bitcoin Reserve, a state-managed fund that will hold Bitcoin as part of the state’s long-term financial assets.
The newly established reserve operates independently of Texas’ general treasury system and aims to strengthen the state’s financial resilience while serving as a potential hedge against inflation, according to the bill text.
Furthermore, only assets with a market capitalization exceeding $500 billion are eligible for inclusion, a threshold currently met only by Bitcoin (BTC).
The fund will be administered by the Texas Comptroller of Public Accounts and guided by an advisory committee of three crypto investment professionals.

## 5. Signal trading ‘school’ and fake exchange rob investor of $860K: Lawsuit

**列表標題**: Cointelegraph

**內容**:
A Florida investor says he was scammed out of $860,000 by a Denver-based trading “school” and a fake crypto exchange that promised him life-changing profits.
In a lawsuit filed last week in federal court, Brian Firestone alleges that the Alpha Stock Investment Training Center (ASITC), which operated out of downtown Denver, partnered with a fraudulent exchange called CoinBridge Partners in Cherry Creek to carry out the scheme.
Firestone says he was first approached in December by a man named John Smith, who claimed to represent ASITC. Smith offered to teach cryptocurrency trading and gifted him $500 to start.
The trading school’s website, now defunct, listed its address as 1660 Lincoln St. and directed users to trade via CoinBridge, which claimed to have raised $10 million from 600 investors. “CoinBridge is really an entirely fake exchange,” Firestone wrote in the complaint.
Crypto school used trade signals to lure investors
ASITC allegedly used a method called signal trading. According to the suit, “professors” would message participants like Firestone with exact trade instructions at a specific time. Students would then click to execute the trade via their CoinBridge account.
Firestone says his initial $500 quickly ballooned to $55,000, prompting him to invest $50,000 more in January. Within weeks, his balance showed $2 million.
“Professor, I must thank you,” Firestone texted Smith on Feb. 8. “My results were outstanding. Thank you for letting me in this trade today. This is so exciting!”
However, the excitement didn’t last. A losing trade reportedly brought his balance down to $12,000. Firestone then wired $470,000 in cash and took a $330,000 loan from ASITC to continue trading. He says his CoinBridge account jumped to $24.5 million, until a trade in USDT on March 9 failed to execute.
“I can’t close it,” Firestone messaged Smith. “I ncant clpsoe it.” Firestone was told a “system error” caused the glitch and erased his balance.
Two days later, he borrowed $1 million more from ASITC, bringing his account to $6.6 million. However, when he couldn’t repay part of the loan, ASITC allegedly shut his account down on May 1.
The suit accuses ASITC, CoinBridge, Smith, and founder Raymond Torres of fraud, theft, and racketeering. The real Coinbridge Partners in Wyoming has denied any connection to the alleged scam.
$2.1B crypto stolen in 2025
So far in 2025, over $2.1 billion has been stolen in crypto-related incidents, with most losses tied to wallet compromises and key mismanagement, CertiK co-founder Ronghui Gu said. The trend points to a growing shift from code-based hacks to targeting user behavior.
In 2024 alone, phishing attacks accounted for over $1 billion in losses across nearly 300 incidents, making it the most damaging method of attack in the crypto space.

## 6. Michael Saylor’s Strategy premium is not ‘unreasonable’: Adam Back

**列表標題**: Cointelegraph

**內容**:
Blockstream CEO Adam Back says Michael Saylor’s Strategy (MSTR) stock premium is within reason, considering how quickly the firm doubles its Bitcoin per share, which reduces risk for investors.
“It turns out in the case of MicroStrategy it’s been 16 months, 18 months,” he told Bitcoin podcaster Stephan Livera at BTC Prague on Saturday, referring to the typical time it takes for Strategy to double its Bitcoin (BTC) per share, noting that the stock has traded at a 2x multiple “on and off.”
MSTR’s track record justifies its premium, says Back
“So you can see that that’s not an unreasonable premium,” he said. Back explained that if Strategy’s Bitcoin per share keeps growing at the same rate, after about a year and a half, investors “would be at an equivalent” of the market net asset value (mNAV) — meaning the stock price would align with the value of its underlying Bitcoin holdings.
“So, you’re derisked actually,” he said.
“It’s got a hard currency base at that level,” he added. MSTR’s net asset value premium is currently about 1.7x based on basic shares and around 1.9x when calculated on a diluted share basis, according to MSTR Tracker. Strategy uses leverage, using financial instruments such as at-the-market equity offerings (ATM) and convertible senior notes to increase its Bitcoin holdings.
Saylor Tracker data shows the firm holds 592,100 Bitcoin at the time of publication, worth approximately $60.89 billion.
MSTR closed the trading day on Friday at $369.70, down 7.45% over the past 30 days, according to Google Finance data.
Back reiterated that when investing in Bitcoin treasury companies, it’s important for investors to consider whether the premium “is reasonable.” He added:
“One way to think about the premium is how many months does it take to overcome the premium.”
Back said that investors face a higher risk when the mNAV is elevated. “It can be a bit speculative when you get higher mNVAVs, but the treasury companies with high mNAVs also have a very high yield,” he said.
MNAV significant fluctuations are going to be “a nervous experience”
Back said that although Japanese investment firm Metaplanet has experienced more volatility with its mNAV, it has generally managed to recover each time so far.
“Metaplanet has fluctuated generally between 10 and 5 mNAV, then of course, if you hold it at 10, then it quickly drops to 5, that’s going to be a nervous experience,” he said.
“But so far, it’s tended to bounce back after that,” he said.
Meanwhile, Metaplanet’s latest 1,112 Bitcoin purchase on June 16 has tipped its total Bitcoin holdings to 10,000 BTC, surpassing Coinbase as the seventh-largest publicly traded company with a Bitcoin treasury.

## 7. Bitcoin Price Drops to $101K, Where’s the Bottom?

**列表標題**: Cointelegraph

**內容**:
The cryptocurrency markets continue bleeding out, with Bitcoin dropping to as low as $101,000 earlier today.
At the time of this writing, BTC recovered slightly and trades above $102,000 but analysts are scraping for answers and looking for the local bottom.
As seen from the 1-hour chart, at least on that time frame, the cryptocurrency has been in a clear downtrend for the past five days, marking lower highs and lower lows consistently.
Data from Coinglass also reveals elevated levels of liquidated positions across the leverage market. Almost $700 million were wiped off, which is a 35% increase compared to the day before. Naturally, the overwhelming majority of that were longs, accounting for around $600 million of the total.
The heatmap below also paints a depressing picture. As you can see, with the exception of LEO, every single altcoin from the top 50 (by market capitalization) is charting significant losses over the past 24 hours.

## 8. Altcoins Turn Red as US Strikes Iran in Major Escalation

**列表標題**: Cointelegraph

**內容**:
The crypto market reflected significant losses as the US officially entered the Iran-Israel war late Saturday night. According to President Trump, the US has bombed notable nuclear sites in Iran, signaling its first active strike in this geopolitical conflict.The crypto market reacted with notable liquidations across the altcoin sector. Ethereum dropped over 5% following the news, trading below $2,300 for the first time in a month. 
Also, Cardano is nearing a 3-month low following the news – down 6% today. AI agent coins suffered the biggest blow, as VIRTUAL and FET dipped nearly 10%.
While Bitcoin still holds above $102,500, indicators suggest it could potentially fall below the $100,000 psychological level if further escalations are reported over the weekend.
Previously, BeInCrypto analysts projected that Bitcoin price could drop 10% if the US entered the Iran-Israel war. 
As of now, the market will be cautiously looking at Iran’s response. President Trump has stated that any response from Iran would result in further US actions.
Overall, crypto liquidations exceeded $670 million today, and further escalation could very well signal a short-term bearish cycle.

## 9. Samson Mow wants Bitcoin in ‘all of Europe,’ receives invite to France

**列表標題**: Cointelegraph

**內容**:
Jan3 founder Samson Mow is setting his sights on ramping up Bitcoin nation-state adoption in Europe following a positive meeting with pro-Bitcoin French lawmaker Sarah Knafo.
“Looking forward to starting a nation-state Bitcoin adoption wave in France and perhaps all of Europe,” Mow said in an X post on Saturday, following his meeting with Sarah Knafo, a French member of the European Parliament, at BTC Prague this week. They discussed plans to develop a Strategic Bitcoin (BTC) Reserve for France and promote “friendly regulations” for the asset.
Mow to visit France to discuss Bitcoin further
Mow said Knafo has invited his team to France. On the same day, Knafo addressed the meeting with Mow on her X account, stating, “France must take hold of these issues.”
Knafo said she had “excellent discussions” with Mow. “An expert on Bitcoin adoption by states, who has advised the President of El Salvador and many others,” Knafo added. 
In March 2022, Mow resigned from Adam Back’s firm, Blockstream, to focus on bolstering nation-state Bitcoin adoption by launching Jan3.
Knafo also met with Strategy executive chairman Michael Saylor, who she said was “visionary and ambitious.” 
Bitcoin momentum builds in France
“We will soon have many projects for France and Europe,” Knafo said.
The invitation comes as France continues to expand its involvement with Bitcoin in both the public and private sectors.
On June 3, Paris-based cryptocurrency firm Blockchain Group, which claims to be Europe’s first Bitcoin treasury firm, acquired 624 Bitcoin for 60.2 million euros ($68.7 million). The latest acquisition brings the firm’s total holdings to 1,471 Bitcoin.
Meanwhile, on March 27, France’s state-owned bank Bpifrance said it will spend 25 million euros ($27 million) buying cryptocurrencies that support local crypto and blockchain projects.
Concerns about crypto adoption rate in Europe
However, some crypto executives have recently expressed concerns that Europe's crypto adoption has been lagging compared to the rest of the world.
On March 29, Elisenda Fabrega, general counsel at Brickken, a European real-world asset (RWA) tokenization platform, told Cointelegraph, "European corporate adoption remains limited.”
“This hesitation reflects a deeper structural divide, rooted in regulation, institutional signaling and market maturity,” Fabrega said.
“Europe has yet to take a definitive stance on Bitcoin as a reserve asset,” Fabrega added.
MiCA, the European Union’s regulatory framework for crypto-assets, was proposed in September 2020, adopted in May 2023, and was fully enforced in December 2024.

## 10. Pump.fun’s Big Launch Put On Ice Over Legal Drama

**列表標題**: Cointelegraph

**內容**:
Pump.fun’s latest delay has rattled its backers. The Solana‐based memecoin launchpad was set to raise $1 billion at a $4 billion valuation on June 25. Now, the team says the sale will slip into mid‑July.
There’s no clear reason for the hold‑up, and users are on edge. Investors who queued up months ago are left wondering if they’ll ever see a token in their wallets.
Token Sale Pushed Into Mid‑July
According to reports on June 20, Pump.fun first hinted at raising $1 billion at a $4 billion valuation. The sale was supposed to start on June 25. Instead, the launchpad now aims for mid‑July. That’s at least a 10‑day shift, and possibly longer.
Users who planned around the June date have to sit tight again. Frustration is growing in online chat groups, where some members point fingers at the core team for poor communication.
Lawsuit Accuses Platform Of Securities Violations
On January 15, Burwick Law filed a class action lawsuit against Pump.fun. The complaint alleges the platform acted as an unregistered securities exchange. It also claims that Pump.fun pumped token prices to lure in retail investors.
According to the complaint, many users saw their holdings plunge in value after the hype died down. Max Burwick, the firm’s founder, called the platform “a modern pyramid scheme dressed as a viral meme economy.”Trademark Claims Lead To Cease‑And‑Desist
Based on reports from February, Burwick Law teamed up with Wolf Popper LLP to issue a cease‑and‑desist order. They argue that several user‑generated memecoins on Pump.fun infringe on trademark rights.
That move opened another front of legal risk. Projects tied to big brands or franchises suddenly faced takedown notices. Pump.fun says it’s beefed up its legal team, but it hasn’t shared details on how it plans to settle trademark disputes.
X Account Suspensions Raise Eyebrows
On June 16, Pump.fun’s official X accounts were locked without warning. An X user known as Otto logged more than 30 profiles that went dark, including handles linked to GMGN and Bloom trading groups. The accounts came back online after a few days, but no one got an explanation.
Some users suspect a regulator asked for the takedown. Others think it was trademark owners flexing their muscles. Either way, the episode fed more chatter about external pressure on the platform.

## 11. Bitcoin CBD Heatmap Marks $95,500–$97,000 As Make-Or-Break Zone – Details

**列表標題**: Cointelegraph

**內容**:
Since hitting a new all-time high almost a month ago, Bitcoin has done little to assure investors of intent to explore new price territories. Amid announcement of new US trade tariffs and rising geopolitical tensions between Israel and Iran, the premier cryptocurrency has come under bearish influences to trade as low as 101,000.
At press time, Bitcoin is hovering near $104,000 following a 2.03% % decline in the past day. However, popular analytics company Glassnode has highlighted a crucial price range worth monitoring especially in the advent of a further price decline. 
Related Reading: Bitcoin Sees Modest Gains, But Demand Weakness Limits Breakout Potential
$95,500–$97,000: Bitcoin’s Line In The Sand
In a recent X post, Glassnode shares an insight into the Bitcoin market based on data from Cost Basis Distribution (CBD) heatmap. The CBD is a common on-chain metric that tracks the price levels at which tokens were last purchased or sold. When a substantial amount of coins are traded within a specific price range, it forms a supply cluster capable of acting as a support or resistance level.
According to Glassnode’s report, the Bitcoin’s CBD heatmap shows the first dense supply cluster below the current market price lies at $95,500 – $97,000 price zone. Interestingly, this range rests just below the short-term holders (STH) cost basis suggesting a confluence of technical and on-chain metric to present a high-stake battleground.Therefore, Glassnode analysts explain that holding the market price above this threshold reinforces bullish momentum and boosts Bitcoin chances of re-entering a price discovery mode. However, a breakdown below the $95,500 price level could trigger panic selling supporting bearish projections for the mid-term to short-term. Interestingly, prominent market analysts including anonymous X expert with username Mr. Wall Street has backed the latter scenario stating Bitcoin is due for a further price drops. Mr. Wall Street strictly warns Bitcoin would not hold above the $100,000 psychological support zone forecasting a price fall to around the $93,000 – $95,000 which Glassnode predicts should induce widescale market liquidations.
Bitcoin Market Overview
At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $103,753 with a cumulative 1.27% decline in the past week. During this period, the flagship cryptocurrency remained largely under $106,000 barring a weak price breakout between June 16 and June 17. On a monthly scale, Bitcoin has now recorded a 6.10% loss, signaling a gradual shift in momentum with bearish forces regaining control of the market. Meanwhile, with a market cap of $2.05 trillion, the “digital gold” continues to rank as the largest cryptocurrency with a reported market dominance of 64.3%.

## 12. Chainlink Bears Push Toward $12.50 As Weekend Volatility Looms

**列表標題**: Cointelegraph

**內容**:
According to an analysis posted on X by CRYPTOWZRD, Chainlink has closed the session with a bearish tone and is now testing the key $12.50 support level. With reduced weekend liquidity expected, price action is likely to remain choppy, making it essential to closely monitor intraday volatility. A clearer setup could take time to develop, but this zone may offer early clues about the token’s next move.
Oversold Pressure Builds: Is LINKBTC Ready To Rebound?
In his expanded commentary, CRYPTOWZRD underscored that both the LINKUSDT and LINKBTC daily candles closed firmly bearish, mirroring Bitcoin’s broader pullback and highlighting the altcoin market’s continued sensitivity to BTC’s moves. He emphasized that this pattern underscores the need for healthier bullish candles to emerge before a sustainable recovery can take hold.
CRYPTOWZRD stated that LINKBTC sits in extremely oversold territory, suggesting that a positive reversal is statistically likely. Should a bounce materialize, he expects it to ignite a sharp upside spike in LINK, effectively flipping sentiment from bearish to bullish in short order.
Turning to absolute price structure, CRYPTOWZRD noted that Chainlink is currently trading right at the $12.50 daily support target, a zone he considers pivotal. A decisive bullish reversal from this level, he argues, is essential to trigger an impulsive upside move and reestablish upward momentum.
If buyers can reclaim control, CRYPTOWZRD identifies $16 as the next critical resistance, followed by a more substantial barrier at $19.50. Clearing these levels would signal that the tide has truly shifted, paving the way for a broader trend change rather than a short‑lived bounce.
Despite this bullish roadmap, CRYPTOWZRD cautioned that Bitcoin’s weekend price action will remain a major influence on Chainlink, especially given the expected drop in liquidity. As a result, he plans to focus on lower‑time‑frame charts in the coming sessions, seeking quick scalp opportunities while waiting for clearer confirmation of direction.
Chainlink Intraday Setup Builds Around $12.85 Decision Point
Assessing the immediate outlook, the analyst notes that LINK’s intraday chart remains bearish and noticeably volatile, underscoring the market’s current uncertainty. Price action has been chopping around key levels, making any clear direction difficult to trust without firm confirmation.
On the bullish side, the analyst points out that a decisive breakout and sustained hold above the $12.85 intraday resistance could flip sentiment. If buyers manage to establish support above this line, the setup would present a compelling long opportunity with an initial upside target near $14.40, where the next significant resistance resides.
Conversely, the analyst warns that a failed attempt to hold $12.85—marked by a retest and subsequent decline- would favor the bears. Such rejection would create potential short setups, as renewed selling pressure could drag the price lower, especially if broader market conditions stay cautious.

## 13. Stablecoin Wars Ignite: Peter Schiff Champions Gold-Backed Digital Assets

**列表標題**: Cointelegraph

**內容**:
Stablecoin backing is under fresh fire after outspoken economist and gold supporter Peter Schiff took aim at tokens tied to US dollar reserves. He argues that relying on a fiat currency he views as shaky makes little sense when a more stable asset exists.
His comments have reignited a long‑running debate about what should sit behind digital coins that promise a steady peg.
Schiff Questions Fiat Backing
According to Schiff, it makes no sense to support a token pegged to a currency that can be inflated away. “I get Bitcoin, but not US dollar stablecoins,” he wrote in a social media post.
He pointed out that fiat money can be printed in large amounts, while gold has a fixed supply and centuries of use as money. Schiff said gold cannot be easily devalued by inflation or reckless monetary policies.
Gold‑Backed Tokens On The Rise
Based on reports, gold‑backed stablecoins are seeing more interest from investors worried about inflation and dollar weakness. Tokens like Tether Gold (XAUT) and Paxos Gold (PAXG) let users move digital claims on physical gold. These assets give the same quick transfers and high liquidity as dollar‑pegged coins but tie each token to real metal stored in vaults.Regulatory Scrutiny Intensifies
Regulators across the globe are racing to establish precise regulations for stablecoin reserves. Congress members in the US are considering tighter reserve and audit requirements. Europe and Asia are creating their own regulations to achieve transparency and safeguard users. Schiff’s call for gold introduces additional context to these discussions. It could lead regulators to explore whether commodities can serve as backing for tokens under particular regimes.Market Reaction Mixed
According to reports, Schiff’s tweet trended, garnering over 500,000 views within 24 hours. Crypto naysayers applauded his observation on fiat risk. Other investors cautioned that gold-backed tokens have higher fees and cumbersome custody expenses. They explained that transferring metal or establishing physical reserves introduces friction when compared with exchanging dollar-backed coins at a bank custodian.
Investors also pointed out that stablecoins are widely used in lending, trading and payments within DeFi platforms. Dollar‑pegged tokens like USDC and USDT dominate these flows because they tie directly into existing banking rails. Gold‑backed coins, by contrast, tend to be held as digital bullion rather than spent on everyday transactions.

## 14. Spot Ethereum ETFs log largest outflows in one month as ETH price tumbles below $2,400

**列表標題**: Cointelegraph

**內容**:
U.S. spot Ethereum ETFs saw their largest outflow since mid-May on Friday, before ether's price tumbled below $2,400 on Saturday. Spot Bitcoin ETFs, on the other hand, continued to set cumulative inflow records with a 9-day streak of net positive inflows. 
The Ethereum ETF outflows were led by a $19.7 million outflow from BlackRock's ETHA fund, the largest such fund on the market by assets under management (AUM). The fund still holds $4.03 billion worth of assets, a hair more than the total AUM of Grayscale's two funds — ETHE and ETH — which hold $4.02 billion combined, according to SoSoValue data.
The outflows from BlackRock's fund were slightly offset by $6.6 million worth of inflows into Grayscale's ETH on Friday and $1.8 million in inflows to VanEck's ETHV fund, with an AUM of $114.8 million. The price of ETH is down about 5% over the past seven days, according to The Block's Ethereum Price page, dipping below $2,400 on Saturday afternoon. 
Despite the outflows, the ETH funds have logged around $840 million in cumulative net inflows since the start of the month. "The data suggests institutions remain constructive on crypto's medium-term upside, but Ethereum's catch-up phase appears to be over," BRN Lead Research Analyst Valentin Fournier told The Block recently.
Bitcoin ETFs keep setting new cumulative inflow records
While Ethereum funds bled, spot Bitcoin ETFs set a new cumulative inflow total high on Friday, the fifth straight day a new record has been set, according to SoSoValue data. The funds have logged $46.7 billion in cumulative net inflows. 
However, Friday's meager inflow of $6.4 million was the smallest inflow sum since June 6, which saw $47.8 million worth of outflows, signaling a possible reduction in demand for the BTC funds. BlackRock's IBIT, the market-leading fund, logged $46.9 million worth of inflows, while Fidelity's FBTC saw $40.6 million worth of outflows. 
Spot Bitcoin ETFs now account for around a quarter of global Bitcoin trading volume, The Block recently reported, though transactions on the actual Bitcoin blockchain are hitting 18-month lows. Speculative bets around Bitcoin-native protocols Runes and Ordinals have largely failed to pan out as demand cools. 
The price of Bitcoin is down around 1% in the past 24 hours, according to The Block's Bitcoin Price page.

## 15. Strategy’s Michael Saylor raises Bitcoin forecast to $21M by 2046

**列表標題**: Cointelegraph

**內容**:
Bitcoin bull and Strategy founder Michael Saylor has doubled down on the long-term value of BTC amid fast-changing geopolitical and cryptocurrency adoption trends.
Saylor took the stage with a keynote speech at the BTC Prague 2025 event on Saturday, predicting that the price of Bitcoin
BTCUSD
would hit $21 million in 21 years.
“I think we’re going to be $21 million in 21 years. It's a very special time in the network. Maybe the one time in the history of the network where you look out 21 years and you see $21 million,” Saylor stated.
Saylor’s latest bullish Bitcoin prediction is a massive increase from his previous forecast made at the Bitcoin 2024 conference in Nashville last year, when he predicted that Bitcoin would hit $13 million by 2045.
Massive adoption that “nobody guessed”
In the keynote, Saylor reasoned his growing bullishness on the Bitcoin market with many geopolitical, regulatory and adoption developments, which he said nobody conceived last year.
“Stuff that’s happened in the past 11 months has been extraordinary. The White House has embraced Bitcoin. This is an extraordinary development. We didn’t anticipate this,” Saylor said.
Saylor emphasized that he has always been bullish on Bitcoin, even when it plummeted to $16,000 in the last crypto winter, but Donald Trump’s presidential victory last November “brought a sea change in politics,” he stated.
“Although we thought we might have a pro-Bitcoin president, we didn't think we'd get a strategic Bitcoin reserve. We didn't think that the president would say America would be the Bitcoin superpower of the world. This is an amazing development,” Saylor added.
The Strategy founder also mentioned growing regulatory and legislative developments around crypto, referring to three crypto-related bills progressing in the US, including the stablecoin-focused Genius Act, the Digital Asset Market Clarity Act and the Bitcoin Act.
“This is something nobody guessed, no one conceived of a year ago. States in the United States are embracing Bitcoin,” Saylor said.
Where does Saylor hold Strategy’s BTC?
Saylor’s new bullish forecast on Bitcoin comes amid Strategy (formerly MicroStrategy) continuing to aggressively accumulate more BTC, purchasing $1 billion worth of BTC last week.
Holding 592,100 BTC as of June 15, 2025, Strategy has not publicly disclosed where and how the company holds its BTC fortune, with Saylor rejecting the idea of publishing proof-of-reserves due to security concerns.
Saylor came under fire last year for also rejecting the concept of self-custody, or the way of holding BTC without relying on any third party, which remains one of the core Bitcoin ideas in the BTC community.
After facing community backlash for suggesting that Bitcoin holders should rather trust their assets to banks, Saylor reversed his stance on self-custody, stating that he supported it for “those willing and able” in October 2024.
In the meantime, the concept of self-custody continued to gain traction at the BTC Prague event, with attendees showing increased interest in “be your own bank” principles.
“BTC Prague continues to attract a strongly Bitcoin-focused crowd, most attendees were deeply engaged with the future of Bitcoin,” Danny Sanders, chief commercial officer at the hardware wallet company Trezor, told Cointelegraph.
One of the main sponsors of BTC Prague, Trezor, welcomed more than 5,000 visitors at the conference, Sanders said. Those included a “vibrant mix of developers, Bitcoiners, and newcomers — all genuinely interested in open-source tools and the principles of self-custody,” he added.

## 16. Bitcoin Active Addresses At 2020 Level — What’s Happening?

**列表標題**: Cointelegraph

**內容**:
The Bitcoin price action in June has displayed healthy swings from a low of about $100,500 to as high as $111,000. While it has lacked the impulsive momentum seen in past cycles for more bullish swings, the premier cryptocurrency has managed to maintain its valuation above $100,000.
Over the past week, BTC has displayed relative price stability, with modest bullish movement at intervals. The cryptocurrency continued to trade within a tight range for most of the week, mirroring a mix of optimism and caution amongst market participants.
Active Addresses Mirror 2020 Levels
In a June 20 post on social media platform X, on-chain analytics firm Alphractal published its recent findings on the Bitcoin active addresses, revealing that the flagship cryptocurrency does not show an indication of market euphoria. 
The relevant on-chain indicator here is the Active Addresses metric, which measures the number of unique addresses that are active on the Bitcoin network within a specific timeframe. To be clear, an address is “active” if it is receiving and sending Bitcoin during a particular period. 
The chart shared by Alphractal shows that active addresses are at the same level as in 2020. The analytics firm pointed out that as of 2020, the market was facing political uncertainty, dealing with a global pandemic, and widespread social fear, as the effects on market engagement are what is currently being witnessed.
In the post on X, Alphractal highlighted two possible reasons for this seeming lack of enthusiasm seen in investors. Firstly, the market intelligence firm noted that investors might have become disillusioned with all that is currently happening in the crypto market, regardless of Bitcoin’s value comfortably being above $100,000.
On the other hand, Alphractal put forward the possibility that this relative inactivity could be a result of a strong long-term conviction in the flagship cryptocurrency as a store of value. However, this second reasoning was immediately put down by Alphractal as readings from two other indicators — the on-chain volume and spot volume — are both low, indicating little global interest in the cryptocurrency.
As Bitcoin still prevails above $100,000, this could be a strong indication, Alphractal explained, “that only the most resilient are taking advantage of the long-awaited $100k per BTC.”
Bitcoin Price At A Glance 
As of this writing, Bitcoin is valued at about $103,290, reflecting an over 1% price decline in the past 24 hours. According to data from CoinGecko, the price of BTC has fallen by about 2.4% in value over the past seven days.

## 17. Historical Bitcoin trend calls for $330K BTC price before bull market ends

**列表標題**: Cointelegraph

**內容**:
Key takeaways:
Bitcoin AVIV Ratio remains below historical peak levels, indicating a potential climb above $330,000 before a cycle top is confirmed.
Over-the-counter Bitcoin holdings are down significantly in 2025, pointing to strategic accumulation by Strategy, Metaplanet, BlackRock and others.
Bitcoin (BTC) price has had a rocky month, but recent analysis indicates that BTC could surge another 300% this cycle. Technical analyst Gert van Lagen’s X post highlights the AVIV Ratio, a metric that compares Bitcoin’s active capitalization (money in motion) to its total invested capitalization (realized capital, excluding miner rewards). 
Historically, when the AVIV Ratio crosses its +3σ mean deviation, it has signaled a cycle top. For example, BTC was $1,200 in 2013, near $20,000 in 2017, and around $69,000 in 2021. Currently, the AVIV Ratio’s level remains below these past peaks, suggesting Bitcoin could climb to at least $330,000 this cycle, before the +3σ mean deviation condition is met. 
The AVIV Ratio offers a unique lens on market dynamics, reflecting investor activity versus locked-in value. A spike indicates heightened trading or profit-taking, often preceding major price movements. Van Lagen’s analysis ties this to Bitcoin’s cyclical nature, where post-ATH rallies have historically delivered significant gains. However, its predictive accuracy lacks validation in varying market conditions, and volatility remains a wildcard.
Adding to the narrative, data from CryptoQuant reveals a notable shift: Bitcoin holdings on over-the-counter (OTC) desks have dropped from 166,500 to 137,400 in 2025. This decline suggests large investors are moving holdings off exchanges, potentially signaling reduced selling pressure or a shift toward long-term storage.
The declining balances at OTC desks this year stem from strategic accumulation by institutional investors, led by Strategy’s aggressive buying, and new entrants like Metaplanet, which has amassed 10,000 BTC, alongside robust net inflows into the spot Bitcoin ETFs, which total $128.18 billion in net value. BlackRock’s crypto portfolio also holds more than $70 billion in BTC, which sums up the current intent of major investors in the market.

Power law puts Bitcoin price target between $220,000 and $330,000
Similar to Van Lagen’s $330,000 price target, another study by Bitcoin researcher Sminston With outlined a comparable cycle top for BTC. With’s analysis leverages a 365-day simple moving average (SMA) aligned with a power law model (R²=0.96), projecting Bitcoin’s price could reach $220,000 to $330,000 in this cycle.
Currently trading around $104,000, BTC would need a 100% to 200% surge to hit these levels, consistent with historical peaks where prices doubled or tripled above the power law trendline.
With’s model challenges assumptions of diminishing volatility, showing Bitcoin’s price cycles retain significant swings, as evidenced by steady deviations from the trendline. While optimistic, the researcher cautions that the analysis draws from only four market cycles, urging skepticism. 
Likewise, Cointelegraph reported that a list of 30 bull market peak indicators from CoinGlass suggests Bitcoin could climb to $230,000, with none signaling a cycle top despite BTC reaching $112,000. Metrics like Pi Cycle Top and MVRV show the bull market has room to run, supporting With’s optimistic outlook.

## 18. All Signs Point To A Bitcoin Liftoff—Here’s What The Experts See

**列表標題**: Cointelegraph

**內容**:
Based on reports from analyst Moustache, Bitcoin may be gearing up for its next big move. The world’s largest cryptocurrency climbed above $105,000 for the second time this week. At press time, it was trading at nearly $104,000, up 0.50% over the past 24 hours.
Historical RSI Breakouts Could Signal New Push
According to the charts shared by Moustache, Bitcoin’s monthly Relative Strength Index (RSI) tends to surge into overbought territory just before major rallies. Back in July 2013, Bitcoin sat at $66, then jumped to nearly $1,120 by November as the RSI hit high levels.
A similar spike happened in May 2017, when BTC rose from about $1,300 to $19,700 by December. On April 1, 2021, Bitcoin reached $64,800 while the RSI again climbed beyond its usual range. In 2024, those RSI peaks came on March 1 at $73,800 and again in November when it cleared $100,000.
Whales Stack Up Bitcoin While Retail Pulls Back
Based on reports from on‑chain data provider Santiment, large holders are scooping up coins even as smaller investors step aside. Over the last 10 days, wallets with at least 10 BTC rose by 231 addresses.
At the same time, retail wallets holding between 0.001 and 10 BTC fell by 37,460 addresses. That shift suggests big players are using recent dips as a buying chance. In past cycles, similar moves by whales have come before sustained price gains.
Overbought But Not Out
Analysts warn that an overbought RSI doesn’t always mean an instant surge. In past runs, Bitcoin often paused or pulled back for days or even weeks before the real rally got underway.
Sometimes the RSI stayed elevated while prices drifted sideways. In 2017, for example, a correction followed the high RSI but the broader uptrend kept going. Today’s RSI is near those same levels—and could linger there for a while.What Comes Next For Bitcoin
Investors will be looking beyond technical cues. Macro events, ETF moves and regulatory announcements may guide the next direction. If institutions continue to accumulate and retail continues to avoid, price pressure will develop.
But a surprise headline or policy change might go the other direction. For now, the intersection of high RSI and increasing whale demand suggests a setup that has fueled previous bull frenzies.

## 19. Bitcoin Price Breakdown Spurs Sell-Offs, Analyst Reveals What Will Happen If BTC Hits 92,800

**列表標題**: Cointelegraph

**內容**:
The Bitcoin price crashed from as high as $106,000 to $102,000 on June 20, sparking sell-offs among investors. Now, crypto analyst Colin has indicated that the flagship crypto could still drop to as low as $92,800 and revealed what will happen if BTC gets there. 
The Current Bitcoin Price Action And What To Expect
In an X post, Colin said that it looks increasingly likely that the Bitcoin price will see a retest of at least 100,800 as the first major level of support. The analyst made this statement as BTC dropped out of a bullish pennant for a second time. The measured target for this bull pennant is $150,000. 
However, with the most recent breakdown, the Bitcoin price threatens to decline further before any potential move to the upside. Colin stated that the next major levels below $100,800 are $97,600 and $92,800. He opined that BTC is likely to quickly rebound from these support levels if it gets there. 
The crypto analyst remarked that this Bitcoin price movement is all possible within the confines of the right shoulder of the larger inverse Head-and-Shoulders pattern. He added that this can make the right shoulder more complete, basically on the same level as the left shoulder. This analysis comes just a day after Colin revealed that BTC has deviated from the global M2 money supply. 
However, he suggested that the BTC bull market is far from over. The analyst noted that the deviation happens 20% of the time and doesn’t invalidate the macro trend. Basically, the Bitcoin price is primed to rally higher at some point and possibly reach the $150,000 measured target. Market expert Raoul Pal also commented on BTC’s correlation with the money supply, stating that it shows that there is no need to worry about the current price action. 
Bulls Need To Step In For BTC
In an X post, crypto analyst Titan of Crypto stated that the Bulls need to step in now for the Bitcoin price. He noted that BTC is facing a key test, having just been rejected at the Fair Value Gap at around $106,000. The analyst added that the flagship crypto is now retesting the lower boundary of the symmetrical triangle. 
Titan of Crypto stated that if this lower boundary at around $104,000 fails, then the next level would be the previous weekly low at $102,679. If the Bitcoin price fails to hold that level, it could further drop to the liquidity pocket near $100,300. 
At the time of writing, the Bitcoin price is trading at around $103,500, down in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.

## 20. Bitcoin Knots gain ground: Will a chain split kill BTC price?

**列表標題**: Cointelegraph

**內容**:
Bitcoin Knots, first released by developer Luke Dashjr in the early 2010s, has long offered a more configurable and policy-agnostic alternative to Core.
Currently, most nodes use the Bitcoin Core client to support the Bitcoin network. However, Bitcoin Knots has grown an impressive 638% since the start of the year, jumping from only 394 nodes to 2,909 nodes as of June 19. This massive growth rate started to see significant upticks in May and now makes up 13.24% of all the nodes supporting the Bitcoin network. 
Bitcoin Knots’ recent popularity spike suggests that a non-trivial share of Bitcoin’s infrastructure operators no longer trust Core to define Bitcoin’s limits unilaterally.
This is not just technical dissent, it is ideological.
The last time node counts shifted this dramatically was in 2017, on the eve of the SegWit2x showdown. Back then, disagreements over block size and miner power fractured the network into Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash.
Now, another schism may be forming. Instead of block sizes, it’s about the soul of the protocol, and it may dramatically impact price stability and adoption by year’s end. 
Did Bitcoin Knots go from fringe to vanguard? 
Bitcoin Knots began as a power-user fork of Core, integrating patches, features and policy tweaks that were too controversial or too early for mainline adoption. It hovered between 50 and 200 active nodes for most of its existence, serving as a staging ground for conservative developers wary of Core’s influence.
From March 2016 through early 2022, node counts barely breached 200. Even during the Ordinals surge in 2023, when BRC-20 tokens and Bitcoin-based inscriptions strained blockspace and sparked renewed debate over what Bitcoin is for, Knots only briefly crested above 1,000 nodes before dropping back.
Then came late 2024. As murmurs of an OP_RETURN cleanup in Core began to circulate, couched in language about pruning, feed efficiency and mempool hygiene, Knots adoption began to climb. By early 2025, it had tripled. By June 19, 2025, it stood at 2,909, with growth still accelerating.
The message behind the numbers is evident. A meaningful subset of Bitcoin’s most technical participants rejects Core’s moral authority. Where it was once assumed that Bitcoin Core spoke for Bitcoin itself, there is a growing appetite for pluralism and perhaps even open defiance.
Bitcoin schism in October 2025?
Tensions escalated further on June 6, when Bitcoin Core developers published a statement signaling a shift toward a “minimally permissive” relay policy. The announcement avoided specific terms such as OP_RETURN or Ordinals, but its implications were clear. Under the new posture, Core clients may soon stop relaying non-standard transactions by default, even if those transactions are valid under Bitcoin’s consensus rules. Critics argue that this policy risks undermining Bitcoin’s neutrality by enforcing a subjective vision of what types of activity should be allowed on the network.
Core’s proposed changes, slated for October 2025, include more restrictive handling of OP_RETURN, the opcode that enables arbitrary data to be embedded in Bitcoin transactions. While this opcode has historically been capped at 80 bytes and discouraged in practice, it has underpinned everything from token issuance via Omni and Counterparty to NFT-style Ordinals in recent years.
Some developers argue that these transactions bloat the chain, crowd out financial activity and should be deprioritized. Others say that selectively disabling or penalizing them violates Bitcoin’s principle of neutrality. If a transaction is valid by consensus rules and pays a competitive fee, it should be relayed and mined.
Knots, notably, do not implement these policy-level filters unless explicitly configured. Its rise suggests that the non-neutrality narrative around Core is gaining traction. In other words, Bitcoin’s policy layer, which was once quietly dictated by a small circle of Core maintainers, is now being contested by nodes switching over to Knots in record numbers. 
This is not yet a hard fork scenario, but it is inching closer. The 2017 SegWit upgrade reached a boiling point when divergent software choices became incompatible. If Core’s upcoming changes cause blocks or transactions to be rejected by non-Core clients, the stage is set for history to repeat.
And with more than 13% of the network already running Knots, this is not just a protest vote but the beginning of a parallel consensus.
Price may be impacted if history repeats or rhymes 
When Bitcoin split into Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash on Aug. 1, 2017, markets responded with volatility but no collapse.
As Cointelegraph reported, Bitcoin (BTC) dropped approximately 5.6%, falling from about $2,875 on July 31 to $2,718 on the fork day.
However, this dip proved short-lived. Throughout August, BTC surged nearly 49%, closing strong at around $4,050, and continued its meteoric rise to almost $20,000 by December 2017. Meanwhile, Bitcoin Cash (BCH) launched trading at approximately 0.0045 BTC (~$240) and skyrocketed to 0.283 BTC (~$1,500) before stabilizing in the $300-$500 range.
Far from fracturing investor confidence, the fork solidified BTC’s dominance and gave dissenters an alternative in BCH.
The stakes, this time, are higher. With Bitcoin ETFs, corporations’ stacking Bitcoin on their balance sheets and the market being potentially poised for blow-off tops in the foreseeable future, this schism could have more market risk than we have seen in the past. 
If Bitcoin Knots keeps its average growth run rate from May through October 2025, there will be over 5,000 nodes running the Knots client. That will equate to around 23% of the entire Bitcoin network.
That level of adoption would mark the largest divergence from Bitcoin Core since the 2017 hard fork, and this time, the rebellion is already inside the house.

## 21. Here’s what happened in crypto today

**列表標題**: Cointelegraph

**內容**:
Today in crypto, Jan3 founder Samson Mow eyes expanding Bitcoin nation-state adoption in Europe, Bitcoin holding company Nakamoto Holdings has secured $51.5 million in fresh capital to purchase more BTC. Meanwhile, CoinMarketCap continues to investigate after its website was hit with a phishing scam.
Samson Mow wants Bitcoin in ‘all of Europe,’ receives invite to France
Jan3 founder Samson Mow is setting his sights on ramping up Bitcoin nation-state adoption in Europe following a positive meeting with pro-Bitcoin French lawmaker Sarah Knafo.
“Looking forward to starting a nation-state Bitcoin adoption wave in France and perhaps all of Europe,” Mow said in an X post on Saturday, following his meeting with Sarah Knafo, a French member of the European Parliament, at BTC Prague this week. They discussed plans to develop a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve for France and promote “friendly regulations” for the asset.
Mow said Knafo has invited his team to France. On the same day, Knafo addressed the meeting with Mow on her X account, stating, “France must take hold of these issues.”
Nakamoto Holdings secures $51.5M to expand Bitcoin treasury strategy
Bitcoin holding company Nakamoto Holdings, founded by US President Donald Trump’s crypto adviser, David Bailey, has secured $51.5 million in fresh capital through a private placement in public equity (PIPE) deal, according to a statement from merger partner KindlyMD.
Bailey said that the new funds were raised in less than 72 hours, reflecting growing investor appetite for Nakamoto’s Bitcoin (BTC) accumulation strategy.
“Investor demand for Nakamoto is incredibly strong,” Bailey said. “We continue to execute our strategy to raise as much capital as possible to acquire as much Bitcoin as possible.”
The financing, priced at $5.00 per share, brings KindlyMD’s total funding to approximately $563 million, and $763 million including convertible notes.
CoinMarketCap has 'identified and removed' malicious wallet scam
CoinMarketCap, a price-tracking website for cryptocurrencies, has reportedly removed a malicious popup notification on its website prompting users to verify their cryptocurrency wallets, according to a post on its official X account.
“We’ve identified and removed the malicious code from our site,” CoinMarketCap said in a post on Friday.
“Our team is continuing to investigate and taking steps to strengthen our security,” it added.
The update came less than three hours after CoinMarketCap publicly addressed the malicious notification amid multiple reports spreading on social media.

## 23. Bitcoin Net Taker Volume Enters Deep Red On Binance — What’s Next For BTC Price?

**列表標題**: Cointelegraph

**內容**:
After another strong play for its all-time high in the past week, the price of Bitcoin has struggled to build on its recent bullish momentum. Over the last few days, the premier cryptocurrency has been specifically slow and lethargic.
On Friday, June 20, the Bitcoin price took a severe hit — together with the rest of the crypto market — and fell briefly beneath the $103,000 mark. However, the latest market data suggests that the price of BTC might enjoy some stability after the recent round of long liquidations.
BTC Gearing For A Run Of ‘Healthier Price Action’: Analyst
In a Quicktake post on the CryptoQuant platform, on-chain analyst Amr Taha explained the dynamics between the Bitcoin price and its recent long liquidation event. According to the online pundit, the market leader could be preparing for more stable price action over the next few weeks.
Taha revealed that the critical $103,000 liquidation cluster, which held a large volume of overleveraged long positions on Binance, has been cleared off. This cascade of long liquidations came after the price of Bitcoin plunged toward the $102,500 level on Friday evening.
According to data from CryptoQuant, the price decline caused the long liquidations on Binance, the world’s largest exchange by trading volume, to exceed $160 million. The on-chain analyst noted that this long liquidation event also coincided with a major change in the Bitcoin Net Taker Volume on the cryptocurrency exchange.
Taha highlighted that the Net Taker Volume has moved deep into the negative territory, falling to nearly -$100 million in the past day. As observed in the chart below, this latest plunge marks the third time the Net taker Volume has fallen to this level in the month of June.
According to Taha, the change in this metric suggests that aggressive selling outweighed buying activity during the liquidation event. The on-chain analyst outlines two possible reasons for this trend, including that long positions were forced to close, pushing sell orders into the market as the Bitcoin price fell below $103,000. 
Taha added that some sections of Bitcoin retail traders might have pushed the panic button and filled new sell orders in fear of further losses. In the end, the crypto analyst concluded that the combination of long liquidations and extremely negative Net Taker Volume might not be completely bad for the flagship cryptocurrency.
Taha said:
While such events often feel devastating in the moment, they lay the groundwork for healthier price action. Given these dynamics, the path of least resistance may now shift upward as Bitcoin stabilizes above key support levels with reduced leverage overhead.

## 24. Texas Bitcoin Reserve Might Pass Without the Governor’s Signature

**列表標題**: Cointelegraph

**內容**:
Texas Governor Greg Abbott has yet to sign Senate Bill (SB) 21, which would establish a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve (SBR) for the state.
On June 20, Abbott signed 306 bills from the 89th Regular Legislative Session, including 15 considered high-priority. One of those measures mandates efficiency audits across state agencies to tighten government accountability.
Legal Groundwork for a Permanent Texas Bitcoin Reserve
However, SB 21 was notably absent from the list, despite its potential to make Texas one of the first US states to hold Bitcoin as a reserve asset.
SB 21 would allow the state comptroller to allocate surplus General Revenue toward purchasing Bitcoin, using transparency and oversight guidelines similar to those already in place for gold holdings in the Texas Bullion Depository.
To maintain asset stability, the bill only permits assets with a market capitalization above $600 billion for two consecutive years. Currently, only Bitcoin meets that standard.
Governor Abbott’s office stated that he is still reviewing over 1,200 bills sent to his desk this session. That includes SB 21, which remains under consideration just days before the automatic enactment deadline.
Still, Julian Fahrer, founder of Bitcoin Laws, noted the missed opportunity for a symbolic signing event, citing similar ceremonies held for other high-profile bills.
“It’s a bit odd he missed the last weekday opportunity to hold a press conference and make a show of it – as he’s done for other high priority bills,” Fahrer said.
However, Fahrer explained that the Bitcoin bill could become law even without his signature on June 22. Under Texas law, any bill not vetoed or signed within 20 days of the legislative session’s adjournment automatically goes into effect.
“It’s in the Texas constitution. 20 days after adjournment, unsigned bills become law,” he stated.
Moreover, the Bitcoin advocate pointed out that Abbott did sign House Bill 4488, which may relate indirectly to SB 21.
That legislation secures certain state-managed funds—possibly including the proposed Bitcoin reserve—by designating them as permanent. These funds could be stored inside or outside the state treasury, based on future legislative direction.
Meanwhile, the Governor’s lack of action on SB 21 has stirred curiosity, particularly given his past support for crypto.
Just weeks ago, Abbott shared news of the bill on his official X account, signaling enthusiasm for blockchain innovation in Texas. He has also backed legislation promoting crypto mining as a tool for economic growth and grid resilience.
